(It is a privilege to be in a school that not only focuses on studies but also propagates art, sports and extra curricular activities. For that we would like to start by thanking Mrs. Gupta for giving us the resources to formulate this committee and our committee’s head teacher Mrs.Ramchandani for her constant support to our team members. We would like to thank our team members for being so cooperative.)(Art Integrated learning is an approach to combining teaching in the classroom to outside real world projects through the medium of art, this way every student can acknowledge the true depths of certain topics which usually cannot be taught through the conventional medium of book and paper. Through this tough year of Covid-19 all routine methods of learning have been left behind and a small era of online learning has taken over art integration projects which makes learning and teaching more joyful.)(Now as we say "actions speak louder then words" so our committee to start off, made a short video demonstrating how art can be integrated into all topics of learning from all junior grades to senior. Our most significant project was to help students who weren’t familiar with the online learning applications, a series of webinars were hosted to teach on how to operate certain applications such as Google drive, Padlet, Quizizz, Infographic, Canva and Edunext.)(A variety of ideas were shared as to how doing projects broadens the horizon of understanding for all students. The webinars held were highly successful and it helped the students a lot with their daily activities of learning in the classroom integrating ICT. In the end I would like to sum up in the words of this powerful quote:)(<i>"Art has the power to transform to illuminate, to educate, inspire and motivate."</i>)
