Being a part of the School events committee was a great opportunity for us students to utilise our maximum potential and contribute for the school activities and events. Organising and managing events during the academic year 2020-21 was surely different and unique from the previous years. Keeping in mind the available resources we had at our disposal & on-going online interactions, the members came up with the most creative ideas for events that still could be organised very efficiently & effectively. Effects were made to help students share ideas, interests, showcase them and their talents through events throughout the year. For instance, the online inter class competition and various other activities. The Fit India School Week was a huge success too. One of the many roles of the committee was to develop communication skills, responsibility, attend & participate in meetings, and assist in planning of school events. The work wasnâ€™t easy, however we were able to achieve majority of our goals, as we had a team of impeccable, par excellent, responsible and radiant members along with the valuable advice and guidance from our mentors ; Mrs I. Yadav & Mrs G. Singh. It has been a great learning experience for us, as we were given a lot of responsibilities and opportunities to explore our selves and use all the available resources to organise each and every event of the school. We would like to take this opportunity to thank our teachers and the committee members for making this a very fruitful, memorable and successful year for the events committee. Lastly but not least I would also to thank our principal Mrs.Gupta for always encouraging us to reach our full potential. This year indeed has been a special year in so many ways.
