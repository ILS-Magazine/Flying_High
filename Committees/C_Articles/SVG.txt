(The year 2020 has been a distinctive year. It made each of us resilient as well as, it taught us how to perceive things from a different perspective.)(With the guidance of our Student Voice Group (SVG) teacher head, Mrs. Sonali Gupta we were able to work with one another as a committee and implement several online events to be able to communicate with the students of our school.)(To begin with, we were able to create a website and an email ID for all students to give them all a platform to put forward their suggestions and voice out their opinions on different activities taking place at school. One of the members of the SVG committee had taken this initiative and delivered a website which made it easier for all students to communicate freely with us.)(We also started a life skills drive, through the online assembly platform. We were able to use this time to learn as well as teach various essential life skills one must know.)(Each member of the SVG group had the responsibility of teaching our fellow peers diferent life skills such as preparing Diwali sweets during Diwali week, learning how to tie a necktie, or how to sew a button onto a shirt.)(Despite the hardships the year brought upon us, as a school and as a committee, we were able to make the most of the opportunities to learn different things and understand the importance of ‘your voice’. None of this would have been possible without our Principal who is also our head teacher, Mrs Sonali Gupta who has been the binding force and guiding light of this committee. We would like to thank her for the guidance she provided. We would also like to thank all the teachers and the members of the SVG who cooperated and supported us for these events.)
