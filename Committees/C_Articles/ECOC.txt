(We, here at the Eco club make it our sole aim to spread awareness about our drastically changing environment and plant a seed of responsibility and love for the environment in each student’s hearts.)(This is done by stressing on the students’ relationship with the environment and in the process, to make students cognizant that such a connection exists; it is imperative that we, as current inhabitants and future leaders uphold, respect and improve our ties with nature for the betterment of all living beings.)(For the next five years, I believe the Eco Club will proceed with the same ideologies and will be able to:)(<ul><li>Find solutions to the innumerable problems related to climate change and a plethora of other environmental problems.</li>)(<li>Identify the rising threats to humanity, due to environmental degradation and take a stand against them.</li>)(<li>To take a step ahead by educating our students about the adverse effects of degrading the environment, because every small step counts.</li>)(<li>Help prime and inculcate in students to strive and develop a healthy, self-sustainable and eco-friendly future for all.</li></ul>)
