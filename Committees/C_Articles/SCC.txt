(<i>"Listening is often the only thing needed to help someone"</i>)(2020 has not been an easy year for many of us. We were all confined to our homes and were not able to communicate with our friends. We had to manage our emotions and had to take care of our own mental and physical health.)(Leading a committee of such importance seemed like a daunting task at first. But with the support of our Head Teacher - Mrs Bajaj , we were able to work together and contribute to the wellbeing of the students of ILS. Counseling works best when there is face to face interaction. Nevertheless we were able to talk to many students personally and help them figure out their problems by the use of social platforms.)(This year, one of our main goals was to spread awareness about Cyberbullying and the means and methods to approach it. We presented this issue and talked about it in our online assembly and made students aware that talking to an adult is wiser than merely telling your peers and stopping there.)(We also conducted a Webinar with renowned panelists, in July, for parents on the topic: Navigating New Normal with Strengthened Bonds. The webinar was a huge success and was well received and appreciated by the parents. Parents were able to understand the present attitude and behaviours of their children and various ways to handle and communicate with their children during the Lockdown.)(We, as Heads of the SCC, learnt a lot and are happy that we could help our fellow students during their hard times. (Lastly, we would like to conclude by saying that talking about your problems to the right people is the most important decision you take as an individual. Be prudent!)
