<i>“Giving is not just about making a donation, it is about making a difference’’ - said Kathy Calvin, CEO and current President of the United Nations Foundation.</i><br>Having the opportunity to improve the lives of the needy is a privilege that brings along its own sense of obligation. It puts one’s life in a perspective that might have otherwise been lost in this digital age of comparison.<br>Participation in various charity drives provides you the golden opportunity to communicate with children at the orphanages or needy schools and the senior citizens at the old age homes in order to exchange ideologies, share personal experiences and spread positivity. Interacting with people across a variety of age groups can indeed strengthen your communication skills as well as networking skills. It can also help you in developing a better understanding of the hardships one encounters during their lifetime.<br>During these unprecedented times of global lockdown, we settled for performing charity from home keeping everyone’s safety in mind. For instance, we provided food and donated pandemic essentials such as high-quality face masks, hand-sanitizers, gloves, etc. within our community. Using Charity Apps on phone such as ‘Charity Miles’ and ‘Free Rice’ also helped us to contribute towards the betterment of the society.<br>There is a reason due to which Charity Committee has been initiated by our esteemed school. We strongly encourage maximum participation or volunteering in this community responsible for aiding the indigent not only for the selfless acts you will be performing but also due to its impacts on you as an individual. Let us all continue making a positive impact on the society and become Indian Language School’s very own Charity Heroes!
