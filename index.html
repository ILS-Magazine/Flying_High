                <p> This year has been a very unusual year for all the mankind globally. The COVID- 19 pandemic has transformed the way we behave, live and think. It has taught us that nothing is more important than our health, well-being and safety. I want
                    to congratulate all the stakeholders on your patience, perseverance and adapting to the new normal. </p><br>
                <p> The journey of frog leaping from face-to-face class to an online methodology of Teaching and Learning has not be an easy one. The school has tried its best to keep the education on track, emotionally support the students and find ways
                    to help them in these unprecedented times. The school has organized several webinars, session and workshops in diverse areas to give every exposure that a child could have got if they were physically present in school.</p>
                <br>
                <p> I strongly encourage everyone to connect using the many technology options available as connectivity is critical and prime during such times when most of us feel disturbed and depressed. With this connectivity we can bring a little humanity
                    back into our daily lives. </p><br>
                <p>The school has reopened in a limited way and we have conducted the Preliminary Examination for the grades X and XII with the minimum staff on the school campus. Proper Social distancing is being observed in and around the school. </p>
                <br>
                <p> With all of us getting vaccinated for COVID by the mid or this year or little later we are going to look behind us and say, it’s over and here we are together standing strong as ever and back at Indian Language School. </p><br>
                <p>Take care! I look forward to seeing you all in person. </p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">Head Boy</p><br>
    <p>Being elected as Head Boy of Indian Language School was something I dreamt of since my early years in school. And what a year my fate decided to grant those wishes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2020 has proven to be a year with a difference. We cannot reflect on this year without mentioning the Covid-19 pandemic and all its effects. &nbsp;It has taught us patience, love, and care for the less fortunate. It has also taught us how to be stronger yet kinder. This pandemic period has also shown how helpless and insignificant we are. None of us would have expected things to have played out this way, but at the end of it, here we are. To give you a break from all of it, let me show how the students and staff of ILS tackled these challenges and still managed to have a great time.

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">Head Girl</p><br>
    <p>I have been a student of ILS for thirteen years and have learnt and gained so much from this wonderful organization that summing it up in a few words is not possible. My journey towards becoming the Head Girl may have started when I was in the second grade. I remember myself as a shy child who would sit quietly at the corner of the class. Thankfully, one day my teacher pushed me to say the word of the day in the assembly the coming week from where a series of events began, ultimately helping me become the Head Girl of ILS.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Last year, as your Vice Head Girl, I learnt a lot which I believed would help me this year, if elected again. However, as we all know, 2020 was far from predictable. <span class="expandheadgirl" onclick="expandheadgirl()" style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer;">Read More...</span</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">Vice Head Boy</p><br>
    <p>&quot;Change is the only thing constant in life&quot; and the year 2020-21 has been a transformational year, to say the least. The spread of Covid-19 led to a global pandemic which ultimately resulted in many changes in the education system. The school building had shut down but the school was still going on. With change comes many new opportunities, students got the time to explore and develop a passion for new creative hobbies while the teachers adopted the new methods of teaching. The school organized several different activities like online assemblies, live classes, virtual counselling sessions, online elections, virtual MUN, life hacks, online tests, and even celebrated the festivals virtually.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a student of Indian Language School for the past 11 years, I consider myself extremely lucky to hold this honour worthy position of a Vice Head Boy and be a part of this prestigious institution. I want to thank our principal, Mrs. Gupta, vice principals, Mrs. Jain, and Mrs. Yadhav, and all the other teachers who have helped me throughout and taught me the smallest of things. I am also grateful to our heads, Tanmay and Saloni, who supported me all along. Even though this extraordinary journey is coming to an end, it will remain with me as a memory that I will proudly cherish for a lifetime!&nbsp;</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">Vice Head Girl</p><br>
      <p>Being a student for 13 long years in ILS, I can assuredly say that it is the best institution to be in. It is the confluence of well educated &lsquo;guiding lights &ndash; the teachers, who burn themselves through their hard work to light up the developing candles and a perfect head to lead the institution &ndash; our Principal Mrs Gupta who from day one insisted on technology-based learning even before the pandemic set in, the benefits of which we are reaping and also the willingness to transform our educational system where we do bold to drop the obsolete and start to nurture the system that can educate rather than evaluate. </p>
<p>Students and parents of 2020, Kudos to all of us for being open to the unexpected and make room for the improbable and unlikely. What we should learn is all the planning and preparation in the world can&rsquo;t prepare you for the many twists that are coming your way, so keep a little space in your hearts for the improbable. You won&rsquo;t regret it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a matter of great distinction to be humbled by the faith reposed by you all in me as the Vice Head Girl of such an eminent school and for this, I would like to thank all those who believed in me and my abilities to lead the school.</p>
<p>We will travel this road together and work in unison to keep the ILS banner flying high up in the sky, mounted with love, hoisted with dignity, and fluttering with grace.</p>

<p>The year started off pretty rough with COVID-19 forcing us into our homes, but this obstacle came with a whole new set of opportunities and possibilities that we had not tried to explore before.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The use of technology led to increased participation in and better quality of counselling sessions. The biggest impact it had was on the mental health sessions where, now, students got the option of asking questions anonymously through Google docs. Apart from this, many creative ideas popped up, such as the creation of the first video newsletter and the virtual assemblies which provided students with a big opportunity to showcase their creativity. Who knew that one day we would see someone cooking in the assembly! Some of these memories made during the pandemic will stay with me for life. Most importantly, all of us will have a unique story to tell our coming generations!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As the year comes to an end, I would like to thank our Respected Principal Mrs. Sonali Gupta, Vice Principals and teachers for steering us in the right direction in this year filled with question marks. I am equally grateful towards the non-teaching staff who worked during the pandemic to implement the safety measures to make our school safe for attendance. My fellow students, I wish you all the very best for your future, the future of ILS.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>May the ILS flag keep flying high!</p>`}
    function expandheadboy(){
        document.querySelector('.expandheadboy').style.display = 'none';
        document.querySelector('.headboy').innerHTML+= `<p><br></p>
<p>I would like to commend the immense efforts put in by our teachers to get accustomed to using new software and helping us realize the idea of &ldquo;Schooling from Home.&rdquo; Due to their efforts, we could experience a seamless transition into online learning as they got us familiarized with Zoom, Google Classroom, TedEd lessons, Nearpod, and several other platforms to keep our learning interesting and uninterrupted.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Even these challenging times could not dampen the spirits of the students of ILS. Despite this sudden change in their lifestyle, students across all grades have adapted brilliantly to a new way of life with online learning. We ensured that even during the lockdown, our festive celebrations took place in the form of virtual special assemblies, whether it be for Independence Day, Diwali or Christmas. I would like to thank the head girl Saloni Khulle, and the Heads of various Committees for their constant support and willingness to help throughout the year.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This year will be uniquely remembered in the history of our school. We were able to carry out events which we wouldn&rsquo;t have in a normal year. ILS held its first online elections, with creative and quirky blogs being used for campaigning. Its first online Prize Distribution was also conducted this year. We were glad to host talk shows related to Coronavirus and have special addresses from a Holocaust Survivor, counsellors, and other professionals. Students would lighten up our day in the morning assembly by showcasing talents such as cooking, decorating, and various essential life skills.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although there is the disappointment of not being able to meet my friends and participate in activities in the last year of school, there is a lot I can look back upon and have fond memories of. The sincere efforts of our principal and teachers, coupled with the motivation of our students, have ensured that our esteemed academy continues to move forward with pride, overcoming any hurdles in its way.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I would like to thank my parents for their guidance and blessings throughout my life.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It has been an honour to serve as the Head Boy of Indian Language School, to have been its student for fourteen years, and have assumed various leadership roles over these years. This school is and will always be my home, the place where I made friends for a lifetime and became the person that I am today. I would like to conclude by saying to my juniors that you are part of a special institution that will support you no matter where you go in life, and I leave you with the responsibility of keeping the ILS Flag moving in the right direction and in all its senses, keep it Flying High.</p>`
